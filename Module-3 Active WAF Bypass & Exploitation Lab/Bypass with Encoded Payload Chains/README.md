# 🧬 Tool 5 – Bypass with Encoded Payload Chains

## 🎯 Objective
To test and demonstrate how chained encoding techniques like Base64 + Unicode + Path Traversal can bypass WAF rules.


## 🔗 Target
- **URL/IP:** http://192.168.1.110/files?download=FUZZ  
- **App Used:** DVWA / Custom vulnerable file handler
- **Tool Used:** Manual + curl + Burp Suite


## 🔒 Payload Chain Examples

| Technique             | Chained Payload                                             | Goal                                |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Base64 + Traversal   | `Li4vLi4vLi4vZXRjL3Bhc3N3ZA==`                               | Decode to `../../../../etc/passwd`  |
| Unicode + Traversal  | `%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd`                             | Unicode traversal path              |
| Mixed                | `..%252f..%252fetc%252fpasswd`                              | Double URL encoding                 |

## 🧪 Testing Process

1. Test endpoint manually with `curl` or Repeater.
2. Encode each layer using tools (e.g., CyberChef, Burp Encoder).
3. Analyze HTTP response for WAF block messages vs successful responses.
4. Identify which chaining technique succeeded.


## ✅ Key Findings

- Basic traversal payload blocked
- Base64 and Unicode-encoded payloads bypassed filtering
- Double encoding tricked normalization engine


## 🧠 What I Learned

- Encoding layers are effective against basic/moderate WAFs
- Order of encoding matters (inner–outer decoding)
- Chained obfuscation is a stealthy way to exploit
