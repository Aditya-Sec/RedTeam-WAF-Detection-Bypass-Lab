# 🧪 Tool 2 – Header Tampering (WAF Bypass)

## 🎯 Objective

Test various spoofed HTTP headers to bypass IP-based blocking, User-Agent filtering, and Referer-based restrictions enforced by WAFs.

---

## 🔬 Target Details

- **Target IP:** http://192.168.1.110
- **WAF Protection:** ModSecurity / Cloudflare (Simulated)
- **Client Tools:** Burp Suite / Python Requests / Browser Dev Tools

## 🔄 Tested Headers

| Header Name         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| X-Forwarded-For     | Used by proxies to forward the original IP |
| X-Remote-IP         | Sometimes read by WAFs instead of REMOTE_ADDR |
| X-Originating-IP    | Found in some mail and web headers |
| Referer             | Can be filtered to allow/block based on request source |
| User-Agent          | WAFs often block common tools like curl, wget |

## ✅ Sample Test Inputs

``http
GET /login HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.110
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
Referer: https://trustedsource.com

🔍 Key Findings

IP Spoofing with X-Forwarded-For can bypass simple IP blacklists
Changing User-Agent to browser-based string can evade automation detection
Trusted Referer allows access when direct navigation is blocked

🧠 What I Learned

How header manipulation plays a role in WAF evasion
Importance of deep parsing of headers on Blue Team side
Simple misconfigurations can be exploited with basic spoofed headers

I’m a Blue Teamer transitioning into Red Teaming, building real-world attack and defense labs.
