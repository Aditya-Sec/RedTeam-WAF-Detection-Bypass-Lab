# 🧪 Header Tampering – WAF Bypass

This test demonstrates how to evade WAF/IP blocks by manipulating HTTP headers commonly used for filtering.

---

🔐 Commonly Tampered Headers:
- X-Forwarded-For
- X-Originating-IP
- X-Remote-IP
- X-Client-IP
- Referer
- User-Agent

---

🔄 Test Cases:

1. X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
2. X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.1.110
3. User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
4. User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
5. X-Remote-IP: 8.8.8.8
6. Referer: https://trustedsource.com

✅ Observations:
- IP-based blocking was bypassed using spoofed `X-Forwarded-For`
- WAF rule filtered curl-based User-Agents, but browser UAs were allowed
- Trusted `Referer` headers helped bypass basic referer checks
