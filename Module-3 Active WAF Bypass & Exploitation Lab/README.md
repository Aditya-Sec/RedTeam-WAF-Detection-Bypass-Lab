# 🛡️ Module 3 – Active WAF Bypass & Exploitation Lab

This module focuses on **active WAF evasion and exploitation**, using advanced techniques to test the real behavior and limitations of WAFs protecting web applications.


## 🎯 Objectives

- Actively test and bypass WAFs using chained payloads
- Fuzz HTTP headers and endpoints to evade detection
- Customize scripts and wordlists to avoid default signatures
- Explore real-world evasion tactics for Red Team simulation


## 🧪 Lab Environment

- **Target Web App:** DVWA / Mutillidae / Custom vulnerable VM
- **WAF Protection:** ModSecurity / Cloudflare / F5 / AWS WAF
- **Client Tools:** Kali Linux, Burp Suite, Python3, FFUF, WFuzz


## 🧰 Tools & Techniques Covered

| Tool/Technique         | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| 🔗 Payload Chaining    | Combine multiple encoding and evasion formats to slip past filters |
| 🎭 Header Tampering    | Modify headers like `X-Forwarded-For`, `User-Agent`, `Host` |
| 📈 Fuzzing (WFuzz/FFUF) | Discover hidden or poorly protected endpoints |
| 🐍 Custom Scripts       | Automate obfuscated requests using Python |
| 🔄 Burp + Extender     | Use extensions to encode, transform, and test payload delivery |

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Understand the layered design of WAFs and how they block traffic
- Learn how attackers stack bypass techniques
- Develop a detection-aware mindset for both Red and Blue Teams
- Practice real-world offensive evasion safely and ethically
