# 🧩 Tool 6 – Header Tampering

## 🎯 Objective
To test whether the web application or WAF behaves differently when custom headers are modified or spoofed.

---

## 🔗 Target
- **URL:** http://192.168.1.110/login
- **Tool Used:** curl / Burp Suite / Postman

---

## 🧪 Example Header Payloads

``http
GET /login HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.110
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
Referer: https://trusted.com
User-Agent: InternalSecurityScanner

## 📂 Output Files

- 📄 **tampered-headers.txt**: Custom headers tested and their effects  
- 📷 **header-tampering-response.png**: Screenshot of a terminal or Burp Suite result


## ✅ Key Observations

- Bypassed IP-based block using `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`
- WAF did not trigger block with modified `User-Agent`
- `Referer` spoofed successfully to simulate internal access
- Application granted access or returned verbose messages

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Some WAFs trust `X-Forwarded-For` headers if not properly configured
- Custom `User-Agent` values can avoid bot detection or be whitelisted
- `Referer` spoofing is useful for bypassing origin-based controls
