# 🧰 Tool 4 – Manual Payload Testing via Burp Suite Repeater

## 🎯 Objective
Manually craft and test payloads to bypass WAF filters by sending modified HTTP requests in Burp Suite Repeater. Useful for identifying how filtering logic works.


## 🔗 Target
- **URL/IP:** http://192.168.1.110/login.php  
- **App:** DVWA / Mutillidae  
- **Tool Used:** Burp Suite Repeater

## 🔧 Test Payloads Used

| Type       | Payload Example                        | Goal                        |
|------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| SQLi       | `' OR 1=1--`                           | Bypass login authentication |
| XSS        | `<script>alert(1)</script>`            | Trigger JavaScript alert    |
| Obfuscation | `%27%20OR%201%3D1--` (URL Encoded)     | Bypass WAF filters          |
| Case Switch| `SeLeCt * FrOm users`                 | Test case sensitivity       |

## 🧪 Steps

1. Intercept login request with Burp Proxy
2. Send to Repeater
3. Modify payloads one at a time:
   - URL encode payloads
   - Alter cases
   - Combine payloads
4. Observe response status, content length, headers
5. Note if payload is blocked or allowed


## 📂 Output Files

- 📄 [`burp-manual-test.txt`](logs/burp-manual-test.txt): Notes of requests sent and responses received
- 📷 [`burp-repeater-screenshot.png`](screenshots/burp-repeater-screenshot.png): Screenshot of Burp Suite Repeater in action


## 🚨 Key Findings

- Basic SQLi payload blocked
- URL-encoded SQLi bypassed filter
- Inline JavaScript was reflected, indicating XSS
- Case variation bypassed WAF normalization

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Manual testing reveals subtle WAF weaknesses
- Encodings and filter order matter in WAF logic
- Importance of methodical testing of bypass payloads
- Burp Repeater allows precise, iterative testing
