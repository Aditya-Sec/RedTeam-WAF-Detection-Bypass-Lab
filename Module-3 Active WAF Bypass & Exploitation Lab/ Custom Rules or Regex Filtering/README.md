# 🛡️ Tool 7 – Custom Rules / Regex Filtering

## 🎯 Objective
To test how Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and security mechanisms filter requests based on specific patterns, signatures, or regular expressions (regex). This helps uncover block/allow rules that can be bypassed with crafted payloads.

## 🔗 Target
- **URL/IP:** http://192.168.1.110/
- **Tool Used:** Burp Suite / curl / FFUF / WFuzz
- **Testing Area:** Input fields, URL params, headers


## 🧪 Custom Payloads for Regex Testing

| Pattern Type         | Payload Example                                | Intent                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| SQLi pattern         | `' OR 1=1--`                                    | Trigger SQL-based filter       |
| XSS script           | `<script>alert(1)</script>`                     | Test reflected XSS filtering   |
| Encoded payload      | `%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E`             | Bypass basic HTML filtering    |
| Keyword bypass       | `admin OR 1=1`, `../../etc/passwd`             | Trigger blacklist keywords     |
| Regex trap payload   | `UNION SELECT password FROM users`             | Trigger regex-based WAF rules  |


## 📂 Output Files

- 📄 `regex-filter-test.txt`: Summary of payloads used and WAF/filter responses
- 📷 `regex-filter-detection.png`: Screenshot of Burp Suite or terminal showing blocked/allowed responses

## ✅ Key Observations

- Requests containing specific patterns were blocked by WAF
- Encoded versions of payloads sometimes bypassed filters
- WAF returned generic 403 Forbidden or custom block pages
- Filtering appears to use keyword and regex match engines


## 🧠 What I Learned

- WAFs often rely on pattern matching to enforce security
- Slight payload modifications (encoding, spacing) can evade filters
- Regex-based WAF rules can be fingerprinted and bypassed
- Manual testing helps tune fuzzing tools for advanced evasion
