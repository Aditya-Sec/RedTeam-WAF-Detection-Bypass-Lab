# RedTeam-WAF-Detection-Bypass-Lab
A hands-on red team project focused on WAF Detection, Bypass Techniques, and Web Application VAPT.

# 🚨 RedTeam-WAF-Detection-Bypass-Lab

This hands-on project simulates a real-world red team assessment focused on detecting and bypassing Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), combined with vulnerability assessments and reporting. It serves as both a practical learning environment and a showcase of offensive security skills in controlled conditions.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- 🔍 Detect Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)
- ⚔️ Perform WAF bypass techniques using various payloads
- 🛠️ Scan for vulnerabilities using open-source tools
- 📄 Generate documentation and reporting templates
- 🎯 Improve red teaming skills with real-world attack simulation

## 📁 Project Modules

| Module | Name                              | Description |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| 1️⃣    | Recon + Vulnerability Scanning    | Perform reconnaissance with Nmap, WhatWeb, and scan vulnerabilities using Nikto |
| 2️⃣    | WAF Detection                     | Detect WAF using WAFW00F and analyze behavior |
| 3️⃣    | WAF Bypass Techniques             | Use Burp Suite and crafted payloads to bypass WAF restrictions |
| 4️⃣    | Web App VAPT + Audit Report       | Conduct OWASP Top 10 checks and document results in a VAPT report |

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to fingerprint technologies and firewalls
- How WAFs behave and how to test their rules
- How to safely use tools like Burp Suite and ZAP
- How to document findings in a professional audit style

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Add SQLi, XSS, LFI bypass techniques
- Integrate custom payloads and Burp extensions
- Expand to include cloud WAFs (Cloudflare, AWS WAF)
- Automation using Python scripts for scanning
